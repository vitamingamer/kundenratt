        <div id="p1"><p>our story:</p> <p>stylesavvy was grounded in 1973 with the intention of creating a unified center for sharing culture through garments. our first big breakthrough in ergonomical studious design propaganda came in 1996, when one of our founding members, eminem, had his rhyming ability sponsored by a young doctor dray. eminem would later go on to inspire one hundred kids in the world with his son "offended". though critically shunned, it became an instant classic within the jamaican community, where it holds a legendary status and cult following to this day. much like how his record: "fack" was a massive hit in venezuela, the mountain bandits of peru would go on to sing "fack" instead of "happy birthday to you".</p></div>
        <div id="p2"><p>our mission:</p> <p>we want to spread positivity and bring forth exponentially increasing money, fame and power to the world. however, once we obtain this, we will leave the world has to offer there! and people will set sights towards the paris fashion week, and the great pirate era will be upon us!</p></div>
